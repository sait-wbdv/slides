            ### Key Takeaways
            - Use `===` when testing for equality (it's safer). Use `==` once you understand truthiness (or you just can't get the job done with `===`).
            - Any value can be converted to a Boolean value:
            
                ```js
                myBool = Boolean(myVar); // Method 1
                myBool = !!myVar; // Method 2
                ```
                
            ---

            ## `if` blocks
            An `if` block only runs if its expression evaluates to `true`

            ```js
            if (condition) {

              code to run if condition is true

            }
            
            run some other code
            ```

            ---

            ## `else` blocks
            An `else` block only runs if all previous `if` and `else if` blocks have evaluated to `false`.

            ```js
            if (condition) {

              code to run if condition is true

            } else {

              run some other code instead

            }

            ```

            ---
            ## `else` blocks
            An `else if` block only runs if its expression evaluates to `true` AND all `if` and `else if` blocks before it have evaluated to `false`.

            ```js
            if (condition) {

              code to run if condition is true

            } else if(condition) { 

              code to run if condition is true 
              AND the previous blocks evaluate to false

            } else {

              run some other code instead
            
            }
            ```
