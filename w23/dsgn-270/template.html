            1.
            2.
            3.

            ---

            ### Example Searches
            How would you rate the following search phrases?
            - Were any words specific to the industry of web development? What are they?
            - How many words are used?
            - What is the skill level of the searcher? What problem might they be solving?
            - How would do you identify high quality results?

            ---

            ## "`How do I build a web site?`"
            - Could be better.
            - It's not domain-specific.
            - It's kind of long.
            - Skill level: probably beginner

            ---

            ## "`Why isn't my CSS doing anything?`"
            - One star.
            - Probably too long.
            - There's no way for Google to answer the question, but it seems to anyway?


            ---

            ## "`web development`"
            - Not very domain-specific
            - Not qualified; there are a lot reasons why someone would use this phrase 

            ---

            ## "`html crash course`"
            - Pretty good
            - Domain specific and qualified
            - Skill level: beginner

            ---

            ## "`css patterns`"
            - "pattern" is one of Tony's favourite words to append to a phrase for nerdy results.

            ---

            ## "`[your fave browser] devtools`"
            - The term "devtools" is (mostly) only used by frontend developers (domain-specific)

            ---

            ## "`most underrated css properties`"
            - The "css" in "css properties" makes "properties" waaaaay more domain-specific

            ---

            ## Identifying high quality results
            Look for search results that:
            - Fit your learning style
            - Solve your problem
            - Have imagery and high visual hierarchy
            - Are current
            - Come from a trusted source

            ---

            ## Convergent vs Divergent Searching
            - **Convergent**: 
                - There is probably one answer to your problem
                - Example: copy/pasting an error
            - **Divergent**: 
                - There could be many answers to your problem
                - You don't have a problem
                - Example: finding an alternative to Codepen using Google Suggestions

            ---

            ## "`codepen vs`"
            - Wait for Google to show completion suggestions
            - What other alternatives can you find using a similar "verses search"?
