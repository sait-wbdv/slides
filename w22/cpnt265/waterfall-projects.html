            ## Questions to ask the client
            ### (Not an exhaustive list)

            ---

            ### 1. Is this a new or existing project?
            - What's the history of the project?
            - What's the purpose of the project?
            - Who are the Stakeholders?

            ---

            ### 2. Does the client have Analytics installed?
            - Get access to the Google Analytics
            - Use the Content Drilldown to learn which site content is most popular.
            - What is the Audience
              - What percentage is mobile traffic?
              - What is the browser share?

            ---

            ### 3. Where is the site going to be hosted?
            - hosted: i.e. with Media Temple, Hostgator, AWS, Azure, etc
              - make sure host has good support
            - on-premise: hosted on site with the client
              - only allow this if the client has an IT department (could be one person)
        
            ---

            ### 4. Where is the site going to be developed?
            - If the servers are different, when how will the site be migrated?
            - Who's credit card will be on the account?
                - Client pays directly?
                - Developer expenses to client?

            ---

            ## How are you getting paid?
            - Time and materials (by the hour)
            - Fixed quote with installments
            - Retainer
            - Product

            ---

            ### Time and materials 
            - Client is charged by the hour
            - Use invoicing software (Tony uses [Freshbooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/))
            - Tony recommends this for beginners
            - Track time in 15 increments
            - Invoice monthly (or every two weeks, if possible)
            - Be explicit in the agreement: "This is not a fixed quote."
            - Cannot charge for invoicing or learning time

            ---

            ### Fixed quote with installments
            - Not Tony's favourite method
            - Ask for at least 25% up front.
            - Schedule installments when phases are "complete"
            - Weigh the installments so you're at least 75% paid by the time the website is ready for launch
            
            ---

            ### Retainer
            - Paid up-front for a set amount of hours
            - Not well suited for development 
            - Great for regular content updates and maintenance

            ---

            ### Product
            - Paying a set price for a defined product or set of features
            - Examples
              - Software packages
              - Software as a service
              - Client training

            ---

            ## Website Legal Requirements
            ### Hire a lawyer for this
            1. Privacy Policy - What info you're collecting from visitors and what you're doing with it.
            2. Terms and Conditions - A contract between the website owner and website visitor.
            3. Copyright Designations 
                - Copyright symbol in the footer is common
                - Are there any attributions?
            
            ---

            ## Project/Business Proposals
            ### Goals and purpose
            - Expectation management
            - Legal obligations
            - Guide during development
            - Closing the contract
            - Finding investment

            ---

            ### Common Proposal Sections
            - Project Overview and Goals

            --- 

            ### Proposal Format
            The final format should fit the situation and client
            - Polished PDF with professional Design
            - Bullet point email (Tony's fave method)
            - "Living" Google Doc or markdown document
