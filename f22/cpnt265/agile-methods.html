            ## Agile Software
            ### Easy to learn, Hard to do

            ---

            ### The agile Philosophy
            Referred to as "lowercase" agile: a way of dev life. 
            1. **Individuals and interactions** over _processes and tools_
            2. **Working software** over _comprehensive documentation_
            3. **Customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_
            4. **Responding to change** over _following a plan_

            See: [The 12 Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

            ### Popular Agile Methodologies
            Referred to as "capital-A" Agile: a book you can buy.
            - [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/) (industry favourite)
            - [Lean](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) (Tony's favourite)
            - [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) (similar-ish to Scrum)

            ## Lean Method
            ### Defining a Testable Business Model      

            ---

            ### Steps in Lean
            1. Document your Plan A.
                - Write down your initial vision (on a lean canvas) and share it with at least one person.
            2. Identify the riskiest parts of your plan.
                - What parts are you least familiar with?
            3. Systematically test your plan.
                - Validate with falsifiable hypotheses.
                - Interview, experiment, iterate.

            ### Lean Canvas
            ![Lean Canvas Diagram](../../assets/images/agile/lean-canvas-numbered.png)

            ---

            ### Tips for Lean Canvas
            1. Sketch a canvas in one sitting.
            2. It's ok to leave sections blank.
            3. Be concise. Fit your plan on a "one-sheet".
            4. Think in the present.
            5. Use a customer-centric approach.

            ---

            ### How to Record your Canvas
            - Bullet point document (Docs, markdown, etc)
            - [Printable template](https://www.google.com/search?q=lean+canvas+pdf)
            - Software-based canvases:
                - [Miro](https://miro.com/aq/ps/lean-canvas/)
                - [MURAL](https://www.mural.co/templates/lean-canvas)
                - [Milanote](https://milanote.com/templates/startups/lean-canvas)

            #### Sections 1 and 2
            ### Problem/Customer Segments
            1. Define a customer segment.
                - Who do you have easiest access to?
            2. List the top three problems this segment wants to solve.
                - What pains do customers want to solve?
            3. Hone in on possible early adopters.
                - Get specific. Who loves your idea enough to test an incomplete product?

            ---

            #### Section 3
            ### Unique Value Proposition
            - One of the most important boxes and the toughest to get right.
            - Why are you different and worth getting attention?
            - Distill the essence of your product in a few words that will fit in the heading of your landing page.
            - Target early adopters.
            - Focus on benefits.

            ---

            #### Section 4
            ### Solutions
            - What is the simplest way to solve each problem?
            - Try not to fall in love with your idea.
            - Bind a solution to a problem as late as possible.

            ---

            #### Section 5
            ### Channels
            - What's the easiest path to customers?
            - Free(ish) vs paid channels.
            - Inbound (blogs, videos, etc) vs outbound (ads, cold calling) channels
            - Retention before referral
                - Return customers are more likely to share

            ---

            #### Section 6 and 7
            ### Revenue Streams and Cost Structure
            - Getting paid is the first form of validation
            - What price should you set?
            - What will it cost to interview 30-50 early adopters?
            - What will it cost to build and launch an MVP (burn rate)?
            - Are you hiring devs or building it yourself?

            ---

            #### Section 8
            ### Key Metrics
            - Find the key number that tells you how your business is doing.
            - Start with [Pirate Metrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcDpxG_Wz-k) (AARRR):
                - Acquisition
                - Activation
                - Retention
                - Referral
                - Revenue

            ---

            #### Section 9
            ### Unfair Advantage
            - Something not easily copied or bought.
            - Examples:
                - Insider information
                - The right "expert" endorsements
                - A dream team
                - Personal authority
                - Large network effects
                - Community
                - Existing customers
