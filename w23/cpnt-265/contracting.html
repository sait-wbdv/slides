            ## Contracting as a Developer
            ### Tony's unofficial advice

            ---

            ## Finding clients
            1. Friends and family
                - Tony's first website: [His Step-mom's](http://clairescott.com/).
            2. Job boards
                - Tony's first paying gig: From U of C Job Board
            3. Client word-of-mouth
                - Next five clients from referrals
            4. Networking (not necessarily networking events)

            ---

            ### Key Goal
            ## Client Expectation management
            - Under-promise and over-perform
            - Battle scope creep by saying no
            - Document meetings and phone calls

            ---

            ## Sole proprietorships
            You don't have to incorporate to operate under a business name:
            1. Register a tradename at a Registry (after a [NUANS](https://www.nuans.com/site/nuans-corporate-name-trademark-reports/en) search)
            2. Take tradename registration to a bank to open a business bank account in that name
            3. Give the tradename registration to your accountant when making a Statement of Business Income on your taxes

            See [this Padlet](https://padlet.com/acidtone/friday-night-pints-contracting-as-software-developer-u3zotj3bww2kk1dd) for common questions and answers from a past event that Tony hosted.

            ---

            ## Questions to ask the client
            ### (Not an exhaustive list)

            ---

            ### Is this a new or existing project?
            - What's the history of the project?
            - What's the purpose of the project?
            - Who are the Stakeholders?

            ---

            ### Existing (Legacy) Projects

            ---

            ### Who is currently working on the project?
            - Who originally developed it?
            - Are they still there? Is there drama?
            - Who is the project lead?

            ---

            ### What do they need? Where do you fit in?
            - Be honest with your skills but...
            - Don't sell yourself short
            - Do you know any colleagues/mentors that can help?

            ---

            ### Where is it hosted?
            - Are they using a password manager?
                - If not, recommend a password manager?
            - What credentials are needed to access the website?
                - Web server
                - Git repos
                - Database server
                - etc

            ---

            ### Does the client have Analytics installed?
            - Get access to the Google Analytics
            - Use the Content Drilldown to learn which site content is most popular.
            - What is the Audience
              - What percentage is mobile traffic?
              - What is the browser share?

            ---

            ### New (Greenfield) Projects

            ---

            ### Is the site replacing a legacy site? If yes:
            - Is there a database?
            - How many users are there? How much traffic?
            - Are there any hard deadlines?
            - Is the host changing?

            ---

            ### Where is the site going to be hosted?
            - **Hosted**: i.e. with Media Temple, Hostgator, AWS, Azure, etc
              - make sure host has good support
            - **On-premise** (rare): hosted on site with the client
              - only allow this if the client has an IT department (could be one person)
        
            ---

            ### Where is the site going to be developed?
            - If the servers are different, when how will the site be migrated?
            - Who's credit card will be on the account?
                - Client pays directly?
                - Developer expenses to client?

            ---

            ## Signing the client
            Every scenario is different but most have the following steps:
            1. **First Contact**: Meeting the client for the first time
            2. **Romance**: Figuring out if you're the right fit
            3. **Non-disclosure Agreement**: Often required before deep discussions can take place
                - This is often Step 2
                - In Tony's experience, asking for and NDA before First Contact is a red flag
            4. **"Sign" the client**: Often called a Statement of Work, but sometimes it's just an email agreement

            ---

            ### Important
            ## Talk to a Lawyer
            - Tony uses [Good Lawyer](https://www.goodlawyer.ca/) for contract reviews and consultations.

            ---

            ### How are you getting paid?
            - Time and materials (by the hour)
            - Fixed quote with installments
            - Retainer
            - Product

            ---

            ### Time and materials 
            - Client is charged by the hour
            - Use invoicing software (Tony uses [Freshbooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/))
            - Tony recommends this for beginners
            - Track time in 15 increments
            - Invoice monthly (or every two weeks, if possible)
            - Be explicit in the agreement: "This is not a fixed quote."
            - Cannot charge for invoicing or learning time

            ---

            ### Fixed quote with installments
            - Not Tony's favourite method
            - Ask for at least 25% up front.
            - Schedule installments when phases are "complete"
            - Weigh the installments so you're at least 75% paid by the time the website is ready for launch
            
            ---

            ### Retainer
            - Paid up-front for a set amount of hours
            - Not well suited for development 
            - Great for regular content updates and maintenance

            ---

            ### Product
            - Paying a set price for a defined product or set of features
            - Examples
              - Software packages
              - Software as a service
              - Client training

            ---

            ### 1. Discovery
            - Often includes free time you contribute before you close the sale.
