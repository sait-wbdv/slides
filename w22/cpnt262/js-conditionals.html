              <dd>The inequality operator checks whether its two operands are not equal. Unlike the strict inequality operator, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of different types.</dd>

            </dl>

            ### Key Takeaways
            - Use `===` when testing for equality (it's safer). Use `==` once you understand truthiness (or you just can't get the job done with `===`).
            - Any value can be converted to a Boolean value:
            
                ```js
                myBool = Boolean(myVar); // Method 1
                myBool = !!myVar; // Method 2
                ```
                
            ---

            ## `if` blocks
            An `if` block only runs if its expression evaluates to `true`

            ```js
            if (condition) {

              code to run if condition is true

            }
            
            run some other code
            ```

            ---

            ## `else` blocks
            An `else` block only runs if all previous `if` and `else if` blocks have evaluated to `false`.

            ```js
            if (condition) {

              code to run if condition is true

            } else {

              run some other code instead

            }

            ```

            ---
            ## `else` blocks
            An `else if` block only runs if its expression evaluates to `true` AND all `if` and `else if` blocks before it have evaluated to `false`.

            ```js
            if (condition) {

              code to run if condition is true

            } else if(condition) { 

              code to run if condition is true 
              AND the previous blocks evaluate to false

            } else {

              run some other code instead
            
            }
            ```

            ---

            ## Key Takeaways
            - Variables have a value of `undefined` until they are assigned. 
            - Declaration keywords (`const` and `let`) are only used the first time you declare the variable.
            - Arrays and objects defined with `const` are still changeable, they just can't be reassigned. 
            - Never explicitly assign a variable to `undefined`. When you need a variable to be "nothing" use `null` instead.

            ## Types of Errors 
            - **Syntax errors**
                - Errors in the rules of writing JS
                - Easiest to debug
            - **Run-time errors**
                - Code technically correct but can't run
                - Example: File/library/module not found
            - **Logic errors**
                - Code is broken but there are no errors
                - Hardest to debug; sometimes takes hours

            ---

            ## Diagnosing Syntax Errors
            1. Check the console for errors,
            2. Find the file and line number of the error
            3. Go to the error in VS Code and look for "squiggly" underlines, and/or code highlighting errors:
                ![Linter Syntax Warning](../../assets/images/errors/squiggly-underline.png)
            4. When in doubt, `console.log()` relevant variables to confirm they are what you expect.
            5. If you still can't figure it out, copy and paste the error and search online. You will often find an answer on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

            ## Common Syntax Errors
            #### Variable declaration and assignment

            ---

            #### Problem: Using a variable that does not exist
            Chrome
            ![Variable Undefined in Chrome](../../assets/images/errors/var-undefined-chrome.png)

            #### Solutions
            - Declare a variable with `const` or `let` before use.
            - Double-check spelling of the variable name

            ---

            #### Problem: `const` variable declared but not assigned (initialized)

            Chrome
            ![Variable Undefined in Chrome](../../assets/images/errors/const-unassigned-chrome.png)

            ##### Solutions
            - When using `const`, assign a value with `=`, OR
            - Declare the variable with `let` instead

            ---

            #### Problem: Re-assigning a `const` variable
            Chrome
            ![Variable Undefined in Chrome](../../assets/images/errors/const-reassignment-chrome.png)

            #### Solution
            - Declare the variable with `let` instead
            
            ---

            ## Debugging Run-time Errors
            1. Check the Console tab for errors
            2. Check the Network tab for:
                - broken file links,
                - network errors.
            3. If an error provides a file and line number, look for "squiggly underlines" in your editor.

            ---

            ## Debugging Logic Errors
            1. Understand what you're trying to accomplish.
            2. Understand what your code is doing.
            3. Form a hypothesis or two before looking at code.
            4. Identify key variables or conditions with `console.log()`.
